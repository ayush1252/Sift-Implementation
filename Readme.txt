From the image above, it is obvious that we canâ€™t use the same window to detect keypoints with different scale. It is OK with small corner. But to detect larger corners we need larger windows. For this, scale-space filtering is used. In it, Laplacian of Gaussian is found for the image with various \sigma values. LoG acts as a blob detector which detects blobs in various sizes due to change in \sigma. In short,  \sigma acts as a scaling parameter. For eg, in the above image, gaussian kernel with low \sigma gives high value for small corner while guassian kernel with high \sigma fits well for larger corner. So, we can find the local maxima across the scale and space which gives us a list of (x,y,\sigma) values which means there is a potential keypoint at (x,y) at \sigma scale.
